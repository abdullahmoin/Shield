              <p class="boutpara">
                This development board provides small plate with the same powerful microcontroller like Arduino Uno. The Arduino Nano is small in size that uses ATMEGA328P Microcontroller.it lacks only a DC Power jack so its work with a Mini-B USB Cable instead of standard one. It operates on 5V DC supply. Remaining all component interface with this device. The RX and TX pin of this device is connected to the TX and RX of the GSM modem of SIM800 Module. D10 Pin is connected to the TX of The GPS module.D2 to D7 Pin is connected to the LCD Display. Then by given a proper power supply and system ground the Arduino is ready to do their job.

          <h3>RTD SENSORS </h3>
          <p class="boutpara">
            An RTD works by using a basic principle; as the temperature of a metal increases, so does the resistance to the flow of electricity. An electrical current is passed through the sensor, the resistance element is used to measure the resistance of the current being passed through it. As the temperature of the resistance element increases the electrical resistance also increases.  The electrical resistance is measured in Ohms. The resistance value can then be converted into temperature based on the characteristics of the element. Typical response time for an RTD is between 0.5 and 5 seconds making them suitable to applications where an immediate response is not required.

            It consists of six wires out of which three wires are used for connection. The TX pin of this module which is connected to the D10 pin of the microcontroller. Voltage supply is about 3.3V to 5V.When Push button is pressed, GPS starts receiving signals from 4 satellites out of the 24 satellites in the orbit. Once if the connection is established the latitude and longitude values of the current location are obtained. The GPS acts as a transmitter. The 5V supply is given to the GPS from the controller

           <p>Figure 1 represents the methodology used in our paper.e device can be activated by just merely pressing the emergency button once. This device gets activated and sends instant location with a distress message to the police preset numbers through a GSM module. The device sends both the distress message with instant location and records the audio of the incident. When the same button is long pressed it activated call to the police and sends message to the police instant location. The location is located using GPS (UBLOX). The audio is recorded using audio recorder and call is made from GSM modem respectively. This GSM Modem (sim 100) can accept any GSM network operator SIM card and act just like a mobile phone with its own unique phone number. The plus point of using this modem will be that you can use its RS232 port to communicate and develop embedded applications. It can be used to send and receive SMS4 or make/receive voice calls. The hidden camera detector can be used anytime to and whether there is any hidden camera in the surrounding to help our privacy. The hidden camera detector works with the help of RF signal interface. When the RF signal is interrupted, camera can be detected. We can also connect the device with our mobile (through Bluetooth HC05), to and our location even if our mobile is lost which can be activated by clicking tracking your mobile button and the location of the mobile is sent to the preset number.</p>
